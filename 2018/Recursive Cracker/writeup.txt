Step 1:
  . we were given a malbolge code.
  . Intially by executing that code we will get a lot of hex values.
  . The starting part of it seems like magic number of zip file.
  . By using online tools I'm able to convert those hex values into a zip file.
Step 2:
  . As the obtained zip file is password protected and we are provided a text file with it.
  . In the text file there are so many strings such that any of them can be password for the zip file.
  . So we can use "Fcrack zip" tool by giving provided text as search place for password.
  . Then we will end up getting the password as "imprudence".
Step 3:
  . Again another zip file is there with no text file as provided before.
  . Now we can try bruteforcing with "rockyou.txt" in tool "Fcrackzip".
  . Finally we will get a password : "rainbow".
Step 4:
  . Now opeing that zip file has a flag.txt in it.
  . Which gives the flag : "flag{Y0u_d1d_1t_br0_k33p_g0inG}".
